            <h1>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</h1>
            <p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageos fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more;</p>
            <h2>To be or not to be, that is the question’ is the most famous soliloquy in the works of Shakespeare <br> – quite possibly the most famous soliloquy in literature. </h2>
            <blockquote>Hamlet is thinking about life and death. It is the great question that Hamlet is asking about human existence in general and his own existence in particular – a reflection on whether it’s better to be alive or to be dead.</blockquote>
